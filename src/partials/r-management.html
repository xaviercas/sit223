	<h4>What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>GLO6 describes self-management as working and learning independently as well as taking responsibility for one’s actions (Deakin 2015b).</p>
		<p>As a cloud student, I have to balance studies with part time employment, some freelancing, and a family life. I have found that procrastination and perfectionism to be the self-management issues I have to grapple with often. The week four seminar discussed some time management techniques and tools. I have been using the Pomodoro technique for a while. I also have been using {{>glo3}}Trello boards{{>g}}, discussed in week seven, although less often. I was pleased to find these classes confirmed I had taken the right steps to manage my time.</p>
		<p>Studying part time makes for a very slow progress. Although I intend to finish my degree by term two 2019 and complete an internship in term three 2019, I frequently reflect about ways of speeding things up. Among the points made in the ‘4D approach to time management’ in week four, I found de-commitment to be a plausible solution to that problem.</p>
		<p>Self-management also includes setting goals, short term and long term (UCD 2015). Many of the activities in this unit required me to analyse my current position and formalise my goals. While The Me in a Minute and resume building focused on ‘me now’, the Skills Audit assignment forced me to spell out my career aspirations in the short and long term identifying the gaps in my skillset and delineate a strategy to address these gaps.</p>
		<p>I found this activity to be challenging. I had to propose valid solutions to address my skill gaps within realistic time frames. This meant thinking clearly about my aspirations and taking them apart into achievable targets.</p>

	<h4>So What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Self-management is about learning independently. Part of the learning process, I feel, is recognizing what is to be learned or, in my case, addressing a chunk of faulty thinking and correcting it. I realise that relying on a vague and feel good notion such as ‘studying for a degree’ as a goal in itself is not enough to provide the drive behind the ambition, particularly over a long period of time.</p>
		<p>The skills audit exercise offered a systematic approach to goal settings. It forced me to break down my goals into smaller manageable pieces. It also provided me with a mean to evaluate progress overtime. Importantly, the end result of the assignment provided not only a plan to achieve my career change goal, but a concrete motivational piece. I intend to keep, update, refer to and add to the skill audit plan as I progress.</p>

	<h4>Now What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>The unit as a whole and the skill audit assignment specifically have helped me formulating my aspirations in concrete terms and provided me with some self-management tools to conduct, plan and monitor my progress. I think it is also important to recognise that this planning is limited in scope. It is restricted to the domain of university studies and addresses only my goals and my aspirations. But I am also a member of a family. As a group, we aspire to some perception of a fulfilling lifestyle.<br>
		The skills audit and the de-commitment strategy are references that I will include in my everyday life in order to inform my decision making process pertaining to studies within the broader context of family life.</p>
