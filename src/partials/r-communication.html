		<p>GLO2 Communication encompasses a range of communication such as oral and written communication as well as interpersonal communication, {{>glo3}}digital literacy{{>g}}, body language and emotional intelligence (Nicole Koehler 2015, pp. 1-5). Communication is a core subject in this unit. Inter-personal communication was initially introduced in week two with {{>glo4}}assignment one{{>g}} {{>glo3}}Media Watch{{>g}}. The following weeks discussed communication in the form of self-promotion.</p>
		<p>The second week seminar required us to develop a Me in a Minute (MIM) speech, a self-promotional piece to showcase a relevant set of skills to a potential employer. The MIM exercise was initiated by the elevator speech exercise of week one. During that online seminar I could not bring myself to come up with an elevator speech. I did not find the premise of the elevator speech scenario inspiring. Arguably, the exercise is important not the context, yet the situation is a trigger for inspiration, I find. The days following I thought about the employment I would like, the sort of person I would likely to enthuse to, and then wrote an elevator speech.</p>
		<p>Although the thought process behind creating a MIM was very similar, there were some notable differences. The foremost is that unlike an elevator speech, a MIM is not based on role play. I was required to expand on a set of skills and other attributes pertaining to my field of study (a catch-22 (Nichols 1970)). While {{>glo3}}I have acquired some IT skills{{>g}} from freelancing I have very little confidence in how these skills compare in an actual ICT workplace. Additionally, I am employed part time in the hospitality industry and I am a career changer. <br>I struggled to write my MIM, but after a while I was able to extract transferable skills from my current and past employment as well, as expand on the small range of hard skills acquired from my current studies and working on websites.</p>
		<p>Week 6 was about developing a resume and cover letter. Having worked on the MIM made the process much easier. However, I took advantage of the resources made available during the seminar and {{>glo3}}sent my resume to Deakin Talent many times in order to get feedback{{>g}}. I was very impressed with Deakin Talent and made full use of the feedback I received. Later on in the unit, the week nine seminar introduced the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA 2017b), a resource I will exploit in order to improve my MIM, resume and other pieces of self-promotional communication.</p>

	<h4>So What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>I found that like the elevator speech, the making of a MIM or a resume need to be driven by the desire to achieve what one wants to achieve in terms of a career. For one thing, the drive is important in order to overcome the aversion I have for self-promotional communication. It is also important for building a piece of communication that speaks honestly to a prospective employer.</p>
		<p>In themselves, these self-promotional pieces were, I feel, a good exercise in {{>glo4}}self-examination{{>g}}. It made me realise that it is necessary to feel comfortable with MyBrand&trade; in order to go ‘out there’ and look for employment as a mature age student.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Now What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Of course, the self-promotional communication skills acquired in this unit will come into full practice when seeking an internship. I also intent to use them to find part-time work as a trainee programmer, and as a consequence I have recently added my MIM to {{>glo3}}my LinkedIn profile{{>g}}. I also intend to look more into SFIA and see how I could integrate the framework into my resume.</p>
		<p>I recognize these skills will need upkeep. I will update my resume and MIM, LinkedIn profile as I proceed in my studies, in accordance with the newly acquired knowledge and referring to this {{>glo4}}self-reflection{{>g}} to remind me of the intangible in the process.</p>
