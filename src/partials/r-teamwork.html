	<h4>What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>GLO7 Teamwork describes a range of inter-personal skills, and knowledge about how a group interacts to reach a ‘common outcome’ (Deakin 2013). Team work is an essential learning in this unit and as we were placed into workgroup, I found that it was important to have a channel of communication. {{>glo3}}I set up a Microsoft office online group which enabled sharing files, group emails and conversation. The group also made frequent use of the BBCollaborate for voice meetings.{{>g}}</p>
		<p>Three exercises required some amount of interaction with other students: {{>glo3}}the Media Watch assignment{{>g}}, the interview practice and the {{>glo3}}scenario{{>g}} {{>glo5}}analysis{{>g}}.</p>
		<p>Unlike on campus students who are acquainted with each other and benefit of seminars to get together as groups, the group work for {{>glo3}}cloud student{{>g}}s is self-organising and I found participation could be an issue.</p>
		<p>{{>glo4}}The week 7 interview practice{{>g}} was organised using {{>glo3}}BB Collaborate{{>g}}. Only two of us out of a group of four turned up for the meeting. I had prepared some questions based on the position the other team member was applying for. At the meeting however, we felt that role playing ‘interview’ was not the right thing to do. {{>glo4}}In retrospect I feel the interview exercise could have benefited from a third party chairing the session{{>g}}. Nevertheless we went through the few questions I had and the exercise turned into an hour long interesting conversation about each other’s employment and aspirations. From the other team member {{>glo3}}I discovered a section of the IT industry{{>g}} about which I was ignorant.</p>
		<p>In week 10, {{>glo4}}the scenario analysis exercise{{>g}} particularly tested our teamwork skills as the assignment had to be completed within a week. A team member and myself organised an initial meeting. Prior to the meeting I worked through the analysis questions, outlining some answers and familiarising myself with the ACS code of ethics and privacy policies.<br>
		A few core questions required {{>glo4}}the identification of an ethical dilemma{{>g}}, which I was unable to outline. I presented my notes at the meeting and for over one hour the group discussed and expanded on each questions. I found the discussion process worked well. Importantly {{>glo4}}we formed a clear agreement that there was not ethical dilemma present in our scenario{{>g}}.</p>
		<p>Teamwork during the {{>glo5}}scenario analysis{{>g}} went smoothly and work was completed on time, in contrast with our first assignment which took over two weeks to complete. From the experience I have realised that being proactive pays off when it comes to remote group work.</p>

	<h4>So What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>The exercises in this unit formed my first experience at group work in the context of university, and, importantly, as a cloud student. Team work in this environment is very different from team work I have experienced in the work place, for instance, where people know each other, some hierarchical structure is in place and expectations are known. I feel that I have now a better understanding of how to approach, and what to expect from {{>glo3}}virtual team work{{>g}} in this particular environment.</p>
		<p>Among key aspects, I have observed that taking the initiative provides oneself with some sense of control over the direction of the project, although I was reluctant to do so, fearing to seem obtrusive. I also found that preparing for meetings, do background research, allows to ask more pointed questions and waste less time. On the other hand, not over planning but rather let the organisation and discussion of meetings free flow facilitates a more interactive environment. To a great degree {{>glo4}}I also found questioning and active listening could turn meetings into a learning platform.{{>g}}</p>
		<p>Conversely, I also learned not to expect too much from others but rather focus on the end task. The disembodied nature of {{>glo3}}remote studying{{>g}} and group work, I feel, make for a lesser sense of commitment to a team, and therefore participation is not always at its best.</p>
		<p>The virtual aspect and the small size of the team also make it hard to frame these group exercises within theories. Identifying the Belbin team types (Cottrell 2015, pp. 140-1) may offer some guidance, but I would be cautious at imposing or attempting to delineate formal roles for each team members. As one team member pointed out, some meeting where more a akin to a chat over a cup of coffee.</p>

	<h4>Now What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Team work skills fit within the broader context of interpersonal skills (Cottrell 2015, p. 129) and I recently had the opportunity to apply some of the point noted in the So What section albeit in a very different context.<br>
		As a member of a not for profit sport club, I was recently, and unexpectedly, called upon to teach classes of 20 or more young children. I found that preparation but not over planning, measured expectation, and importantly listen to what the children have to say make for a productive and fun class.</p>
		<p>For the sake of learning about new technology, {{>glo3}}I intend to look into tools such as Slack{{>g}} the next time I am involved in a team situation.</p>
		<p>These group exercises have been a new experience for me. They have provided me with a formal understanding of teamwork and also enabled me to build an approach to {{>glo3}}remote group work{{>g}} which I believe will serve me well in my studies.</p>
