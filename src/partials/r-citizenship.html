	<h4>What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Global citizenship is about the skills required to engage with a social and cultural environment other than one’s own. Global citizenship incorporates the skills required to identify, from one’s own discipline-related cultural circle, with a group that does not share the same knowledge (Deakin 2015c) and behave ‘ethically and productively in the professional context’ (Deakin 2015a).</p>
		<p>From week eight to week ten including assignment three, this unit introduced {{>glo4}}professionalism{{>g}} and {{>glo5}}ethics in the workplace{{>g}}. In week nine, {{>glo3}}I visited the website sfia-online.org{{>g}} to assess my current skills against the framework (SFIA 2017a, 2017b). The Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), I find, is a good tool to communicate one’s own skills across various discipline, and one that I will make use of. One of the topic discussed in week ten was internship. SFIA, or {{>glo3}}the Australian Computer Society (ACS){{>g}} equivalent, will help me to {{>glo5}}address the specific requirement of a future internship position{{>g}} and, if anything, appear more professional.</p>
		<p>Another example on the topic of global citizenship was the work done in {{>glo4}}assignment three{{>g}}. The exercise required our group to identify a number of {{>glo4}}ethical issues in a workplace scenario{{>g}}. From this exercise I leaned that to {{>glo5}}refer to authorities such as the ACS Code of Conduct and others{{>g}} helped articulate an informed appraisal when faced with an ethical dilemma.</p>

	<h4>So What?</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Global citizenship is about identifying my ICT-related cultural knowledge and expectation in order to understand other’s discipline-related culture.</p>
		<p>Through freelancing I am currently involved in a job for a long standing client. They, my client, required a ‘visual’ update of their site. {{>glo3}}The site is built upon an old open source content management system. My client has a set of expectations regarding the visual look of their site. They envision a clean and simple layout, such as the flat designs currently trending in web design, in their eyes a simple visual update. My understanding of their request matches their design vision, but not simply as a pretty look, but rather as the design being the direct consequence of a mobile first and responsive approach. The core of their current site depends on a single outdated JavaScript framework and the poor separation of concern makes for a slow and error prone updating process.{{>g}} Although I have made the client aware of the situation, the fact remains that I feel the pressure is on me to update the site within a reasonable time frame.</p>
		<p>In this scenario, I have clearly failed to reach out to my client appropriately. {{>glo4}}From an ethical point of view, on the one hand, I, arguably, have not advised my client firmly enough about the potential for problems ('ACS Code of Professional Conduct' 2014, p. 7e). On the other hand, my relationship with the client is such that, for instance, all jobs to date have been agreed upon verbally and casually.{{>g}}</p>
		<p>As mentioned earlier, a requirement of assignment three was to {{>glo4}}identify an ethical dilemma{{>g}}. I recognise that in my current scenario, an awareness of the ACS Code of Conduct could have informed the delicate balancing between nurturing a long standing relationship with my client and acting in a more professional manner.</p>

	<h4>Now? What</h4>
	<div class="read">
		<p>Through the ACS Code of Ethics, I can identified various path to follow in regards to the scenario above. It is very likely I will complete the job mentioned, present a prototype and reiterate the potential downfalls of upgrading. One thing is certain, however, I will incur a cost. For the sake of the exercise, simplicity and privacy, I have omitted many pertinent details.</p>
		<p>Through this unit I have had the opportunity to explore ethical conduct. I intend to register for membership with the ACS as I believe it will be beneficial in the future.</p>
